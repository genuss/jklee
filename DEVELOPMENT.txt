Release flow

Every commit in a PR built is uploaded to GitHub packages repository. The version pattern is this
    <next version>-<GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER var><commit sha>.
Every commit in the default branch is considered a release and uploaded to both GitHub packages and Maven Central.
The version patter is:
  <next version>
Despite the fact, the package is uploaded to Maven Central, it's not published by default (i.e. visible by consumers).
This process is made manually by the project owner at the moment.
Every commit in the default branch increments a patch part. In case if a minor or major change is
required, the following must be done:
- Push a commit with a version change.
- Drop the release in Maven Central.
- Push a tag with the new version. Tag Format is 'v1.2.3'.
- After the new artifacts are uploaded to Maven Central, publish the release.
