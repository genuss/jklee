Release flow

Every commit in a PR built is uploaded to GitHub packages repository. The version pattern is this
    <next version>-<GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER><GITHUB_SHA>.
Every commit in the default branch is considered a release and uploaded to both GitHub packages and Maven Central.
For every commit a release is also created in GitHub.
The version pattern is:
  <next version>
Every commit in the default branch increments a patch part. In case if a minor or major change is
required, the following must be done:
- Push a commit with a change (e.g. by merging a PR).
- Push a tag pointing to the just created commit with the new version to the default branch. Tag Format is 'v1.2.3'.
- Drop the publication made by the first workflow run.
- Publish the publication with the updated version.

In case if minor or major change isn't required, the publication must be done manually by the project owner anyway.
